# Next Greater Element I

**Source:** LeetCode #496 — Next Greater Element I

## Problem Statement

The next greater element of some element `x` in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of `x` in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the next greater element of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return an array `ans` of length `nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the next greater element as described above.

## Example

**Input:** nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
**Output:** [-1,3,-1]
**Explanation:**
- For number 4 in nums1, there is no next greater number for it in nums2, so the output is -1.
- For number 1 in nums1, the next greater number in nums2 is 3.
- For number 2 in nums1, there is no next greater number in nums2, so the output is -1.

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4
- All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
- All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
