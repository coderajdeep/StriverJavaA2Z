# Non-overlapping Intervals

**Source:** LeetCode #435 — https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

## Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

## Example

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

## Constraints

- 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
- intervals[i].length == 2
- -5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4
