# Coin Change II

**Source:** LeetCode #518 — https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Example

**Input:** amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** There are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

**Input:** amount = 3, coins = [2]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

## Constraints

- 1 <= coins.length <= 300
- 1 <= coins[i] <= 5000
- All the values of coins are unique.
- 0 <= amount <= 5000
